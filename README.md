# 100DaysOfCode-Discord.py
This is the report for the 100DaysOfCode Discord.py bot challenge.

## Log

**Day 1**: Today I made the basic folder structure, made the bot run and added my first commands! Also, the bos has a userstatus now.

**Day 2**: I added a Userinfo and Serverinfo command, made some error handling and added a event logger.
