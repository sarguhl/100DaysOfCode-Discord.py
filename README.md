# 100DaysOfCode-Discord.py
This is the report for the 100DaysOfCode Discord.py bot challenge.

## Log

**Day 1**: Today I made the basic folder structure, made the bot run and added my first commands! Also, the bos has a userstatus now.

**Day 2**: I added a Userinfo and Serverinfo command, made some error handling and added a event logger.


**Day 3**: Hey, a cool new feature! I added a live support. That means, you as a user can directly communitcate via the bot with the moderator team. Just by sending him a cute DM :D

**Day 4**: Today I started working on a help command, I followed a cool and simple system of making command groups. 
Also, yesterday some bugs appeared with live support. They got fixed, yay! I also added a new command for the livesupport.

**Day 5**: Pheww.... today I spend a lot of time on the challenge. I fixed a few bugs and made super advanced ban and kick and mute/unmute command! They work pretty well.

**Day 6**: Ha nice! I actually just had to fix one bug today. Anyway, I added a welcome message that will greet the user in a specific channel. It has an randome welcome sentence and some fu  facts from an API. Also, it has an random generated Embed colour.

**Day 7**: Well actually I had to fix a few bugs. But now we got a cool and smooth clear command. I also updated the GitHub-repo

**Day 8**: Today I opened up a new file for fun commands. The first command I made was a dice command. It was really hard because there's more logical stuff in it than you think. But it works!

**Day 9**: After some cool bugfixing, I added two other commands (wokring with APIs)
